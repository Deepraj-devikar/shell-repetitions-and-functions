# Repetition Practice Problems with for loop

1. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.
    1. program :- twoToPower.sh

2. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints the nth harmonic number. Harmonic Number is of the form
    1. program :- harmonic.sh

3. Write a program that takes a input and determines if the number is a prime.
    1. program :- isPrime.sh

4. Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime Numbers in that range.
    1. program :- whichArePrime.sh

5. Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input. 5 Factorial – 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    1. program :- factorial.sh

6. Write a program to compute Factors of a number N using prime factorization method. Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency. O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N.
    1. program :- factors.sh


# Repetition Practice Problems with while loop

1. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n till 256 is reached..
    1. program :- twoToPowerUpTo256.sh

2. Find the Magic Number
    1. Ask the user to think of a number n between 1 to 100
    2. Then check with the user if the number is less then n/2 or greater
    3. Repeat till the Magic Number is reached..

3. Extend the Flip Coin problem till either Heads or Tails wins 11 times.
    1. program :- win11Times.sh

4. Write a Program where a gambler starts with Rs 100 and places Re 1 bet until he/she goes broke i.e. no more money to gamble or reaches the goal of Rs 200. Keeps track of number of times won and number of bets made.
    1. program :- gamble.sh


# Functions Practice Problems

1. Help user find degF or degC based on their Conversion Selection. Use Case Statement and ensure that the inputs are within the Freezing Point ( 0 °C / 32 °F ) and the Boiling Point of Water ( 100 °C / 212 °F )
    1. degF = (degC * 9/5) + 32
    2. degC = (degF – 32) * 5/9
        1. program :- degreeConversion.sh

2. Write a function to check if the two numbers are Palindromes
    1. program :- palindrom.sh

3. Take a number from user and check if the number is a Prime then show that its palindrome is also prime
    1. Write function check if number is Prime
    2. Write function to get the Palindrome.
    3. Check if the Palindrome number is also prime
